# Find_symmetric_pair

# Question 

Two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) are said to be symmetric if c is equal to b and a is equal to d. For
example, (10, 20) and (20, 10) are symmetric. Given an array of pairs find all symmetric pairs
in it.

Note: Solve using Hashing and return only one of the symmetric pair in output

# Example 1:
Input: Array_pairs = [[11, 20], [30, 40], [5, 10], [40, 30], [10, 5]]

Output:[[30,40],[10,5]]

# Example 2:
Input: Array_pairs = [[11, 20], [40, 30], [10, 5]]

Output: []
